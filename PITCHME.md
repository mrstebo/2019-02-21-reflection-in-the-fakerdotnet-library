### What the F does F do?!
#### Who needs descriptive method names :eyes:

---

@ul

- Looks for **"{FakerName.Method}"**
- Replaces with the result of a call to the faker method

@ulend

---

### So this

---

@size[0.7em]("My name is {Faker.FirstName} {Faker.LastName}")

---

### Turns into this

---

@size[0.7em]("My name is John Smith")

---

### How does it look without reflection?

### How does it look WITH reflection?
